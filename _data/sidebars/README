The following directory contains the different sidebar menus that will be used throughout
the generated web site.  These sidebar menus will be displayed on the left of the article
that is being generated.  They will offer a means to navigate through the site with respect
to the current page.  These menus will offer more flexibility to navigate through the site
compared to the main top level menu.

The sidebar menu will be stored within a YAML file using the following format.

sidebar:
    title: <Main Sidebar Menu Title>
    entries:
        - entry: <Entry Title>
          url: <Local Page Url>
        - entry: <Entry Title>
          ext-url: <External Page Url>
        - subbar: <Subbar file name>
        - title: <Submenu Title>
          submenu:
            - entry: <Entry Title>
              url: <Local Page Url>
            - entry: <Entry Title>
              ext-url: <External Page Url>
            - subbar: <Subbar file name>

Thus every sidebar starts with the "sidebar" attribute.  The "sidebar" attribute will then
have a "title" and "entries" attributes.  The "title" attribute will define the title of
the sidebar.  While the "entries" attribute will contain sidebar menu definitions.  The
"entries" attributes can define the following attributes:

    - entry/url
    - entry/ext-url
    - subbar
    - submenu

The "entry" attribute will be associated with a "url" or "ext-url" attribute.  The difference
between the two is the the "url" points to a page within the current site while the "ext-url"
points to a site outside of your current site.  While the "entry" attribute specifies the
title associated with the passed link.

The subbar attribute will reference a sub-sidebar that is located within the subbars
sub-directory.  The subbar format will be described within that subbars sub-directory README
file.

The submenu attribute will contain the same attributes that the sidebar entries attribute
contains.
