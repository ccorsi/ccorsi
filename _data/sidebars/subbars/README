The following directory contains the different subbar menus that will be used throughout
the generated web site.  These subbar menus will be part of the sidebar displayed on the
left of the article that is being generated.  These subbar menus will offer more
maintainability of the different menu definitions.  This will then make it easier to 
confine menu definitions within a single file that can then be used within one or more
sidebar file.

The subbar will be stored within a YAML file using the following format.

subbar:
    entries:
        - entry: <Entry Title>
          url: <Local Page Url>
        - entry: <Entry Title>
          ext-url: <External Page Url>
        - subbar: <Subbar file name>
        - title: <Submenu Title>
          submenu:
            - entry: <Entry Title>
              url: <Local Page Url>
            - entry: <Entry Title>
              ext-url: <External Page Url>
            - subbar: <Subbar file name>

Thus every sidebar starts with the "sidebar" attribute.  The "sidebar" attribute will then
have a "title" and "entries" attributes.  The "title" attribute will define the title of
the sidebar.  While the "entries" attribute will contain sidebar menu definitions.  The
"entries" attributes can define the following attributes:

    - entry/url
    - entry/ext-url
    - subbar
    - submenu/title

The "entry" attribute will be associated with a "url" or "ext-url" attribute.  The difference
between the two is the the "url" points to a page within the current site while the "ext-url"
points to a site outside of your current site.  While the "entry" attribute specifies the
title associated with the passed link.

The subbar attribute will reference a sub-sidebar that is located within the subbars
sub-directory.  The subbar format will be described within that subbars sub-directory README
file.

The "submenu" attribute will contain the same attributes that the sidebar entries attribute
contains.  While the "title" attribute will define the title of the submenu.
