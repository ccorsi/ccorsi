    Sidebar and Footnotes Page Layout
    ---------------------------------

The following page can be used to generate a page that will contain a sidebar and/or footnotes.

To be able to generate a sidebar you need to include the sidebar attribute in the front matter of your page.
The sidebar definition will then be defined within the data, (_data by default), sidebars sub-directory.  This
is usually a YAML file that contains the required sidebar format.  The format is described within the
sidebar.html file located within the include, (_include by default), directory.  You can then add the sidebar
attribute to the front matter:

---
layout: footnotes
sidebar: [name of the sidebar file without the suffix]
...
---

To be able to generate footnotes you will need to include the id attribute in the front matter of your page.
There is also the need for you to the after-footnotes.html to the after-content attribute in the front matter
of your page.  You will also need to include a javascript in the assets/js directory that is defined as 
${id}-footnotes.js.  This script is generated using the footnotes.js include file.  You then need to create
that file and assign it the following front matter:

---
layout: footnotes
id: [simple identifier]
type: [more complete descriptive name]
values: [array of an array of size two where the first entry is the key prefix and the second an abbreviation of the first]
length: [maximum length of the footnote entry]
minimum: [minimum amount of text needed to include footnotes]
debug: [true, if you want your script to include debug statements as part of your script]
printNode: [true, if you want to print the currently processing node]
...

{% include header.html type="page" %}

{% include quotes.html %}

<div class="row">
    <div class="col" id="{{ page.id }}">
        {% comment %} Determine if the following page uses a sidebar for navigation. {% endcomment %}
        {% if page.sidebar %}
        <div class="col-4-auto float-sm-left pr-5">
            <!-- This is the left column -->
            {% include sidebar.html sidebar='site.data.sidebars[page.sidebar]' %}
        </div>
        {% endif %}

        <!-- This is the middle column -->
        {{ content }}

            FYI: This was the original way of adding footnotes to the given page.
            We now use the after-content front matter attribute to add a footnote
            specific div that is generated by the footnotes.js layout.

            Add a footnote div that will be populated given certain conditions

            <div id="math-footnotes"><div><b><em>Footnotes:</em></b></div></div>
        {% endcomment %}
    </div>
    <!--
    <div class="col-2">
        &lt;!-- This is the right column --&gt;
            {% comment %}
            Do we actually need to extra div to be able to display our page that is used to generate
            mathematical documentation?
            {% endcomment %}
    </div>
    -->
</div>
