    The following include script was taken from the Beautiful Jekyll Theme created
    by Dean Attali located at https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll

    It has been simplified and enhanced to provide the ability to optionally add
    the async attribute to the script element.

{% assign js=include.js -%}
{% if js.href -%}
  <script src="{{ js.href }}" {% if js.sri %}integrity="{{ js.sri }}" crossorigin="anonymous"{% endif -%} {%if js.async %}async{% endif -%} ></script>
{% else -%}
  <script src="{{ js.src | default: js }}" {%if js.async %}async{% endif -%} ></script>
