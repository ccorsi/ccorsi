This layout is used to generate a page that will contain a list of book reference type list.
It was designed such that you can create separate reference pages that can be associated to
a particular set of documentation.  The reference data is supposed to be found within the
site data directory, _data by default, within a references subdirectory.  Each reference 
page will need to define the following properties:

    references: This is the name of the file that contains the book references

While the following standard options should be used but isn't required.

    permalink:  This is the destination of the generated reference file.
    title:  The title of the particular references, defaults to "References"

It is recommended that you create you reference files within the references directory
such that the default "References" title can be used.  You can always change the default
location of the reference directory by updating the configuration file references attribute.

We are using the APA 6th Referencing Style Guide to format the references.

Before continuing to document how to format the data that is required for the different
APA 6th Referencing Style Guide.  We need to list the different formats that will be
generated using the above guide.  Let us look at what we need to look for and then define
the actions that will be taken given this information.  This can include the format of
the data file that is generated in YAML.
