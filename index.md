Well here I go again.  Here is another attempt at creating a web site that I can use to write about different things that interest me.
This time around I can confidently state that I am in a better position to continue to use this current incarnation of my web site.  I
do hope to be able to produce consistent content on this web site.  It doesn't imply that the current state of this site will stay as
it is now.  It is possible that the site can change but not in any drastic way that would require an extensive amount of work.  Let me
then talk about what I am trying to accomplish here.

## Objective

The objective of this site is to find an avenue in which I can write about different subjects that interest me.  This includes articles 
that describe least used information that I know I will find useful in the future but that I know I will not remember.  This is the case
with things that are usually done once and then never updated.  For example, I might configure an operating system feature that doesn't
need any other updates.  This type of information will not be useful with that current operating system configuration but will be useful
when moving to another machine that requires the save configuration.  The other objective is to write up about working experience that
might be useful to others in the field.  This can include anything connected with developing software.

While the above is a viable objective.  There is the question of what to do with my current web sites?  I have created one that is found
at <a href="./learning/">Learning</a>.  There is already some interesting information there that I like to keep but I have come to dislike
the format of the site itself.  There are things about it that doesn't sit well with me while there are other things about it that I really
like.  Thus, I will be taking most if not all of the content that was created within that site and integrate it within this main site.
This is just part of what I plan to do with this current incarnation.

There is the question of what will this incarnation be like now?  Well, I do have some initial plans besides that one mentioned above. I
do intend to create some separate self contained sites relative to this url.  Those include a personal one that I will use to store a list
of books that I have read with pertinent information.  This will be hosted at the following <a href="/books/index.htm">link</a>.

Well, that is it for now...
