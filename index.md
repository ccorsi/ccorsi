## Introduction

Well here I go again.  Here is another attempt at creating a web site that I can use to write about different things that interest me.
This time around I can confidently state that I am in a better position to continue to use this current incarnation of my web site.  I
do hope to be able to produce consistent content for this web site.  It doesn't imply that the current state of this site will stay as 
it is now.  It is possible that the site can change but not in any drastic way that would require an extensive amount of work.  Let me
then talk about what I am trying to accomplish with this web site.

## Objective

The objective of this site is to find an avenue in which I can write about different subjects that interest me.  This includes articles 
that will describe different knowledge that I know will be useful in the future but that I will just not remember.  This is the case will
things that is usually done once and then never updated.  For example, I might configure an operating system feature that doesn't need any other
updates.  This type of information will not be useful with that current operating system configuration but will be useful when moving to 
another machine that requires the save configuration.  The other objective is to write up about working experience that might be useful to
others in the field.  This can include any connected with developing software.

While the above is a viable objective.  There is the question of what to do with my current web sites?  I have created one that is part of this 
url at <a href="./learning/">Learning</a>.  There is already some interesting information that I like to keep but I have come to dislike 
the format of the site itself.  There are things about it that doesn't sit well with me while there are other things about it that I really
like.  Thus, I will be taking most if not all of the content that was created within that site and integrate within the main site.  This is 
just part of what I plan to do with this current incarnation.

There is the question of what will this incarnation of my site be like now?  Well, I do have some initial plan besides that one mentioned above.
I intend to create some separate self contained sites relative to this url.  Those include a personal one that I will use to store a list of books
that I have read within pertinent information.  This will be hosted at the following <a href="/books/index.htm">link</a>.

```cpp
/**
This is a simple class definition.

@since 10.1
*/
public class point {
private:
    int m_x, m_y;
public:
    point(int x, int y) : m_x(x), m_y(y) {
    }

    int x() const { return m_x; }
    int y() const { return m_y; }
};
```

```java
public class Point {
    private int x, y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    int getX() { return x; }
    int getY() { return y; }
}
```
