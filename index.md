The objective of this site is to find an avenue in which I can write about different subjects that interest me.  This includes articles
that describe subjects that I know I will find useful in the future but that I know I will not remember.  This is the case with things
that are usually done once in a while.  For example, I might configure an operating system feature that doesn't need any other updates.
This type of information will not be useful with that current operating system configuration but will be useful when moving to another
machine that requires the save configuration.  The other objective is to write up about my work experience which could be useful to
others in the field.  This can include anything connected with developing software.

While the above is a viable objective.  There is the question of what to do with my current web sites?  I have created one that is found
<a href="./learning/">here</a>.  There is already some interesting information there that I like to keep but I have come to dislike
the format of the site itself.  There are things about it that doesn't sit well with me while there are other things about it that I really
like.  Thus, I will be taking most, if not all, of the content that was created within that site and integrating it within this main site.
This is just part of what I plan to do here.

There is the question of what will this site be like now?  Well, I do have some initial plans beside the one mentioned above. I do intend
to create some separate self contained sites relative to this url.  Those include a personal one that I will use to store a list of books
that I have read with pertinent information.  This will be hosted at the following <a href="/books/index.htm">link</a>.

Well, that is it for now...
