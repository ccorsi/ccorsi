This is that main page of the section that will talk about different programming languages that I have used and/or
learned throughout my time developing software.  It is my intention to provide experience that I have learned about
using these different programming languages.

At the moment, I will just describe different aspect that I have learned when using the different langauges.  I do
intend to learn new features of the different languages that I already know.  While also trying to gain knowledge
with languages that I have yet to learn.  There will also be occasions that I find myself relearning a language that
I haven't used in awhile, for instance Ruby.

The main objective of these pages is more to be able to have a single place that I can access to gather knowledge
about things that I have learned and used in the past but that I haven't used frequently.

So you are welcome to come along and let us enjoy the ride together.
