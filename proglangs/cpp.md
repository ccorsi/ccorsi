Welcome to my personal C/C++ page.  We will be discussing the different aspects that I have learned about using the 
C/C++ programming language.  This landing page will contain information that I think is useful for myself.  If it 
becomes useful to others than that is more than I could expect.  I do hope that what I have to say will be beneficial
to others besides myself.

Let us then begin our journey into C/C++.
