Welcome to my site.  Let me start by telling you a bit about myself.  I am a software engineer by trade but have found
many things interesting besides the computer science field.  My primary joy has always and will always be Mathematics.
I have been fascinated with Mathematics from a young age and that fascination hasn't abated since then.  I do have a
Bachelor in Applied Mathematics that I have always wished that I could use but alas that has not been the case.  My
recent interest in AI is not something that is surprising since in University I was interested in what was then called
Pattern Recognition, which gives you an idea of how old I am.  While Mathematics is my first love it isn't the only
thing that I enjoy.

The other passion that I have is reading non-fiction and fiction books.  I have enjoyed reading diverse subjects like:

- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Psychology
- Philosophy
- Mathematics (Real Analysis, Topology, Number Theory, Differential Equations, Calculus, Probability, etc)
- Computer Science (Distributed Systems, Programming Languages, Agile Development, etc)
- Buddhism
- Taoism
- Confucianism
- Pirating
- Mysteries
- Science Fiction
- Thrillers
- Horror

The above list is just some of the different types of books that I have enjoyed in the past and will continue to enjoy
in the future.  While the above list contains general subject titles.  Those can include many different specific types
of books I have enjoyed reading about.  Let us take Physics for instance.  I have read the following specific subjects
about Physics.

- Relativity
- Quantum Mechanics
- String Theory
- Classical Mechanics
- Biographies on Physicist like Richard Feynman, Wolfgang Pauli, Niels Bohr, and others
- Big Bang Theory
- Particle Physics

While the above list doesn't imply that the books I read are only technical books they do include a list of general
audience books related to the topics above.

While my interest in books is not my only pleasure,  I also enjoy listening to music, watching movies and other
activities that aren't sedentary.

Well, you must forgive me for my meandering about things that aren't really interesting.  Nonetheless, I do hope that
you will find something interesting here that will bring some value to you.

Let us then enjoy the ride together.
