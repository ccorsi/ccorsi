This section includes different C/C++ tools that I have used throughout my career.  These tools have become
a main stay with me because of their usefulness.  Thus this section includes information about these C/C++
tools that others can find useful.

## CMake

**CMake** is a C/C++ build tool that was developed by [KitWare](https://www.kitware.com/){:target="_blank"}
with the goal of simplify the ability to build products for different operating systems.  Basically, CMake
simplifies the process of building products for different operating systems.

**CMake** helps minimize the Makefile from hell syndrome that one needs to concern themselves when building
a C/C++ product across several operating systems.

While **CMake** is only one of several build systems that one can use.  There are other popular ones like
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/){:target="_blank"} and [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/){:target="_blank"}.
These are not the only ones that you can use to build your C/C++ projects.

## GoogleTests

**GoogleTests** is a testing framework that was initially developed by
[Google, LLC](httsp://www.google.com/){:target="_blank"} that was then open sourced to allow others to
benefit from this work.  It has many different features that makes it easier to create, build and
execute tests against a C/C++ projects.

There are other test frameworks that one can use like
[Boost.Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html){:target="_blank"} and
[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2){:target="_blank"}.  While the above ones are some other popular
test frameworks.  There is one that I have used in the past that was just a simple include file called
[TUT framework](https://github.com/mrzechonek/tut-framework){:target="_blank"}.  Thou, I thought this to be
a nice testing framework.  It isn't being supported like the above testing frameworks.

## Compiler Explorer

**Compiler Explorer** is an interactive online compiler that shows the generate assembly code associated with
different languages including C/C++.  I have really enjoyed what this tool provides and it also can be useful
when one is trying to see what happens when you build your code using different compilers.  This tool have
been used extensively by Jason Turner
[C++ Weekly With Jason Turner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHAlbZQNFU2LgEtiqd2Maw){:target="_blank"}
YouTube channel.

yourself.
