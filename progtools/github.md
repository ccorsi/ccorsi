This is the landing page for information about [GitHub](https://www.github.com){:target="_blank"}.  We will be looking at
the different features and explain what they are used and their usefulness.  Let us start by defining with what is GitHub?
The GitHub documentation states that [GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share and work together with
others to write code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git){:target="_blank"}.
This is a very good description of what GitHub is.  It has also evolved throughout the years to what it is now.  It has
become a very useful tool for organizations since it off loads the need to be able to setup and maintain this type of
system.  While this is not the only platform that can be used.  There are others that can be used like
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org){:target="_blank"} and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"}.  I have
use these two tools in and out of a work environment during my career.  These two tools are just as useful but have
difference between the two.  This doesn't imply that GitHub is necessarily better than either one but that they both
provide similar features that are implemented differently.

GitHub provides the ability to mange the development of a project by providing the following features.

| Feature | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Code | Management of a project source code using Git |
| Issues | Management of bugs, enhancement and others of the project |
| Pull Requests | Code review feature |
| Actions | This is GitHub WorkFlow used for CI/CD creation and running |
| Project | This tool provides the ability to manage the project roadmap |

While the above offers a general explanation of what they are used for.  They don't describe the details of these
features that are by of GitHub.  GitHub offers these features for any repository that was created within GitHub.  They
just describe what can be do with a particular repository.  These repositories are created using Git and are managed by
GitHub.  There are other features that go beyond the above features that will be discussed within this section.

While we can continue to discuss more about what GitHub has to offer but we will look at these features within their own
sections.  Currently, the sidebar on the left lists different sections that describe the GitHub features is used
frequently.
