This section contains information about the different JavaScript tools that can be used to develop a
client and/or server side JavaScript projects.  The main purpose is to create notes on what I have found
interesting about using these JavaScript tools.  There is plenty of resources that one can look at that
explains and shows one how to use these JavaScript tools.  I will only write about things that I have
found interesting about the JavaScript ecosystem.
