I want to start by saying thank you for taking the time to look my blog.  I hope that your time here will be fruitful.
I have decided to create this blog where I just talk about things that have nothing to do with my work or things related
to it.  It is my hope that I can provide some interesting and broad blog items that will interest you.  I know that I
enjoy learning about different things and hope that you will find something interesting for you along the way.
</br>

Enjoy,
</br>
