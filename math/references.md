This page contains all of the different references referenced in the Mathematics section of this web
site.  The intention is to combine all the different references from the different mathematical
topics into this single reference because the different mathematical subjects reference similar
references within those pages.  The task of creating unique mathematical references for each of the
different mathematical topics would only cause confusion instead.
