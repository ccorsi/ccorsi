This section deals with the subject of Number Theory which is a branch of Mathematics that deals with integers and
their relationships.  While the above definition is pretty straight forward.  The study of Number Theory is more
involved than its current definition.  This section will then look at the different aspect of Number Theory and will
hopefully provide some clarity for this field.  My interest in Number Theory started when I took a Computational Number
Theory class.  This class got me interested in how to determine if an integer is a prime or not.  While it also got me
interested in how to factor an integer.  This class then lead me to try and understand this branch of Mathematics.

I will then delve into this subject once again to renew my interest in this particular branch of Mathematics.  This
section will then be referencing several books like
{% include citation.html references=page.references key=6 file="math" %} and other Number Theory books.
