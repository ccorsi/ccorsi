In this section I will be looking at the elementary teachings of Number Theory that I have learned while reading
different Number Theory books.  I will be initially following the teachings from the {% include citation.html
references=page.references key=6 file="math" %} book.  This section will then be following the format of that book but
it will not be confined to that format as I go through other elementary number theory books that contain a better
distribution of the material.  In the end, I hope that others will find this information useful beyond my own interest
of this particular branch of Mathematics.
