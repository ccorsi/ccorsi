The following section will contain information that I find useful that doesn't necessarily have a section within this web
site.  It doesn't imply that one or more of the following notes won't become their own section.  It just means that this
is where they are just starting out.

## Python argparse Action Default Value

The argparse Action subclassing has to define the *default* attribute for this value to be used when this parameter was not
used on the command line.  Otherwise, the default value set with the add_arguement call will not be used when the parameter
was not used on the command line.

The Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.Action" target="_blank">Action</a> class can be
used by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" target="_blank">argparse</a> package to allow user specific
action types.  I was looking at creating an Action that will determine if the passed directory exists.  

This section will contain different types of notes that I will find useful that really don't have a real section in which
they should correspond to.  While the notes might start small they can end up growing pretty quickly that they might find
themselves moving to another section within this site.  Hopefully these notes will become useful to others besides myself.
While I am sure that these notes can be found somewhere and in those cases I will offer their references.  While others
muight just be something that I have figured out or notices somewhere that I will probably forget.
